-- Town ETH Flow Traces - Materialized Table
-- Table: dune.towns_protocol.result_town_traces
--
-- IMPORTANT: Flow classification prioritizes protocol fees over town perspective
-- - Town → Protocol Treasury = 'protocol_fee' (NOT 'town_out')
-- - Town → Users/Router = 'town_out' 
-- - This means 'town_out' does NOT include protocol fee payments from towns
